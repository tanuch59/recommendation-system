# **Recommendation System leveraging Meta's LLaMA3 large language model (LLM)**

The Recommendation System for Wall Colors is a project designed to assist users in selecting the ideal wall color for their living environments. The technology gives individualized recommendations based on machine learning algorithms and user preferences.

### **Features**

**Extraction**: Use the pretrained CNN model to extract features from new images.

**Color Prediction**: Use the trained model to predict the best paint color. 

**LLaMA Refinement**: Use LLaMA 3 to refine or provide descriptive color recommendations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
HTML/CSS/JavaScript (for frontend development)

### The Process Workflow for the project is as follows:

1. Data Acquisition and Setting up.
2. Extracting the Feature.
3. Train the Color Prediction Model
4. Fine-Tuning LLaMA3
5. Building the Recommendation System
6. Create the user interface.
7. Test and Validation

### Usage

1. Access recommendations system.
2. Upload an image of your room to the system.
3. Provide details such as room's existing color and light sources.
